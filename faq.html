				  <h1>FAQ</h1>
				  <p>Although many of these questions are answered in greater  detail on other pages of our website, the basic answers may help cover many of  your questions.</p>
				  <ol start="1" type="1">
				    <li>
				      <h2>How       long a trail do I need?</h2>
				    </li>
			      </ol>
                  <p>There is no minimum or maximum  trail length.  Successful installations have  been achieved on trails ranging from 1/8-mile to over 2 miles.  The flexibility Fit-Trail systems offer is  one of its many advantages.</p>
                  <ol start="2" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>What       if I don&rsquo;t have enough land for a trail?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Buyers with limited space have two  options.  One is to cluster several  exercise stations together at multiple points along a trail, thereby shortening  the length of the required trail.  A  second option is to group <strong><u>all</u></strong> the exercise apparatus into a small  area using our Fitness Center option, which places an entire Fit-Trail system  into an area smaller than a tennis court, eliminating the need for a trail.</p>
                  <ol start="3" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>What       kind of surface should my trail be?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>This is totally your option, and  can be anything that allows comfortable and steady footing for walking, jogging  or running.  This might or might not be a  paved surface, a turf surface, or a locally indigenous surface such as crushed  stone, pea gravel, packed sand, etc.</p>
                  <ol start="4" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>What       is included in a Fit-Trail system?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Regardless if you use our 20  station system, our 10 station system, or if you use it in a &ldquo;trail&rdquo;  configuration or a clustered &ldquo;center&rdquo; configuration, you&rsquo;ll get the same type  of components.  These consist of:  introductory signs, and station signs, in pre-assembled  wood timber frames; wood timber exercise apparatus, cut to size and pre-drilled  for easy re-assembly; all hardware, assembly instructions, layout and  installation guide, and directional arrows to guide users to the next exercise  station.</p>
                  <ol start="5" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>Can       Fit-Trail systems be used by seniors?        By children?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Yes.  Our systems are designed for users of all  ages and fitness levels.  Of course, if  individual users are unable to perform any of the exercises, they can simply  pass them and go on to the next exercise station.</p>
                  <ol start="6" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>Is       there a recommended sequence for the exercises?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Yes, although it is not  mandatory.  However, both our 10 station  and our 20 station systems were designed with the recognized benefit of  starting with warm-up and stretching exercises, followed by progressively more  challenging or strenuous exercises, and concluding with less challenging  exercises.  At the end of each system are  cool-down and relaxation opportunities and at multiple points within the system  there are heartbeat monitoring instructions and fitness facts.</p>
                  <ol start="7" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>How       involved is installation, and do you provide it?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Installation is a relatively simple  task, although it does require digging, assembling wood timbers, and pouring  concrete . . . so strong backs and willing hands are essential!  Although SouthWood is able to provide an  installation quote if one is needed, this is not typically cost-effective for  buyers, especially if they are not within a few hundred miles of our Charlotte,  NC location.</p>
                  <ol start="8" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>Where       can I find a Fit-Trail installed near me?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>With thousands of Fit-Trail systems in use all over the world, many on private property or having been sold to other than the end user, we are unable to provide specific locations available for public use. Please inquire of your local park department, and request a Fit-Trail system be installed near you.</p>
                  <ol start="9" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>Do       you offer a warranty?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Absolutely!  All wood components are guaranteed for 10  years, and all signs are guaranteed for 5 years, including breakage.  See our full warranty spelled out elsewhere  on this website.</p>
                  <ol start="10" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>How       do I go about placing an order?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Call or email us directly.  SouthWood is the manufacturer and distributor  of the Fit-Trail brand exercise systems, and the only venue for purchasing  Fit-Trail products.  We sell direct to  end users, government agencies, general contractors, etc., so you pay no agency  commission or broker fee when buying direct from us.  We accept corporate and government purchase  orders, and payment can be made by check, credit card, or wire transfer.</p>
                  <ol start="11" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>How       soon can I get my Fit-Trail?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Typically, shipment occurs with 2-3  weeks of receipt of your order.  At times  we are able to offer almost immediate shipment direct from inventory at our  factory.  If time frame is a priority for  you, be sure to tell us when you call 1-800-727-6884.</p>
                  <ol start="12" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>What       about shipping?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Due to their size and weight, all  Fit-Trail systems are shipped by common carrier motor freight.  With weights starting at nearly 2000 pounds  and up to 4000, costs for shipping will depend upon your exact location.  Shipping costs are typically from several  hundred dollars on up, but if you can provide us a destination zip code for  shipping, we will obtain a quote for you.   All motor freight shipments are prepaid and added to your invoice,  avoiding the costs and hassles of C.O.D. shipments.</p>
                  <ol start="13" type="1">
                    <li>
                      <h2>What       is the price of a Fit-Trail system?</h2>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Our 10 station system is $5,995 and  our 20 station system is $8,995.</p>
